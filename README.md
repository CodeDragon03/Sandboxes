# Sandbox

This repository serves as a centralized collection of small, standalone projects. It is utilized as a development environment for prototyping, experimentation, and skills practice before undertaking larger-scale projects.


## Repository Structure

This repository employs a branch-based organization model. Each project is isolated within its own dedicated branch.

* The **`main`** branch contains only this `README.md` file, which functions as a directory and guide to the repository's contents. No project code is stored on the `main` branch.
* All other branches are self-contained mini-projects. The branch name serves as the project identifier (e.g., `react-todo-app`).

This methodology ensures that experimental projects remain isolated, maintaining a clean and organized version history.

## Project Navigation

To access a specific project, you must check out the corresponding branch.

**Using the Command Line:**

1.  Fetch all remote branches to ensure your local repository is up-to-date:
    ```bash
    git fetch origin
    ```
2.  Switch to the desired project branch:
    ```bash
    git checkout <branch-name>
    ```
    *Example:* `git checkout python-web-scraper`

**Using the GitHub Interface:**

Select the desired project from the branch selection dropdown menu located at the top-left of the code repository view.
